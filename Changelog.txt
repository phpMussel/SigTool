=== Version/Release 1.0.0 ===
MAJOR RELEASE (BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE).

- [2020.03.01; Maikuolan]: Renamed "sigtool.php" to "SigTool.php" to align the
  name of the file more closely to the name of the class. Added a separate YAML
  class to handle all YAML functionality; SigTool will now extend that YAML
  class, instead of trying to define any YAML functionality itself (strictly
  speaking, this violates the idea of SigTool existing purely as a singular
  file, free of any dependencies; but, having now two files instead of one, in
  my opinion, isn't really a big deal, and it's more maintainable now anyway,
  so I think, a good way to proceed moving forward; this violation is also the
  reason why I've opted to mark this release as a major release, as opposed to
  minor or patch). Added some code to guard against regular expression-based
  signatures that contain quantifiers that might exceed PCRE's limits, which
  could result in compilation failure.

- [2020.03.07; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: A reconstructed "signatures.dat", after
  processing new signature files, should be prefixed by "---"; not by
  "0: false". The code wasn't properly accommodating this; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 0.2.3 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2018.12.19; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Split apart the YAML handler
  a little more (doesn't change anything functionally, but should help to
  slightly reduce complaints sometimes made by certain code quality checkers
  and such). It's also less messy now to use an integer value of zero as a key.

- [2018.12.23-25; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translating the SigTool
  README to German, Russian, Korean, and Japanese. This totals 14 translations
  now available.

- [2019.01.25; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Upped the hashing algo used
  for generating checksums by default from MD5 to SHA256, seeing as the latter
  is already supported by phpMussel anyhow (thus having zero implementation
  cost).

=== Version/Release 0.2.2 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2018.10.23; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved signature file
  optimisation to reduce signature file footprint and to filter out some more
  possibly problematic signatures.

=== Version/Release 0.2.1 ===
PATCH RELEASE.

- [2018.06.28; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Refactoring.

- [2018.10.20; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added some code to simplify
  some of the syntax normally used by ClamAV signatures, and added some code to
  remove some specific signatures during the signature file generation process
  that can otherwise sometimes trip up PCRE during the scan process.

Caleb M (Maikuolan),
October 20, 2018.

=== Version/Release 0.2.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2017.08.22; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added new options for offsets in
  signatures. Removed some duplicated code. Removed processing for terminal
  offsets (I don't think these really exist in ClamAV signatures, and what I
  was treating as these in the ClamAV signatures, are for something else, that
  we don't need for phpMussel, and I'd misunderstood about them before).

- [2017.08.29-09.05; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the
  SigTool README documentation into Spanish, French, Indonesian, Italian,
  Dutch, and Portuguese. This totals 7 different language versions of the
  README documentation now available.

- [2017.09.05; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved progress display.

- [2017.09.10; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the
  SigTool README documentation into Vietnamese. This totals 8 different
  language versions of the README documentation now available.

- [2017.09.16; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the
  SigTool README documentation into Chinese (simplified and traditional). This
  totals 10 different language versions of the README documentation now
  available.
