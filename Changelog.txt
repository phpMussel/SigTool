MINOR RELEASE.

- [2017.08.22; Minor code change; Maikuolan]: Added new options for offsets in
  signatures. Removed some duplicated code. Removed processing for terminal
  offsets (I don't think these really exist in ClamAV signatures, and what I
  was treating as these in the ClamAV signatures, are for something else, that
  we don't need for phpMussel, and I'd misunderstood about them before).

- [2017.08.29-09.05; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the
  SigTool README documentation into Spanish, French, Indonesian, Italian,
  Dutch, and Portuguese. This totals 7 different language versions of the
  README documentation now available.

- [2017.09.05; Sub-minor code change; Maikuolan]: Improved progress display.

- [2017.09.10; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the
  SigTool README documentation into Vietnamese. This totals 8 different
  language versions of the README documentation now available.

- [2017.09.16; Documentation; Maikuolan]: Completed translation for the
  SigTool README documentation into Chinese (simplified and traditional). This
  totals 10 different language versions of the README documentation now
  available.
